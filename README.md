# Browser Boost
Improved keyboard shortcuts for navigating the web without reaching for the mouse.
Vim like shortcuts for scrolling on page. 
While focused on the body, "j" to go down, "k" to go up,
"gg" to jump to the top of the page,
"G" to jump to the bottom of the page.
A small blue indicator will be shown at the bottom of every page if the body is selected
and navigation is possible. Pressing "Ctrl+/" will blur the current element selecting the body.
Pressing "Ctrl+'" will open a menu displaying text over every link. Pressing the letters on
that link will navigate to that page.
